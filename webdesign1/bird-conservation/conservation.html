      <h1>Conservation efforts</h1>
      <p>
        Various kinds of work are carried out in Ireland in order to protect
        bird species.

      <h2>Research and monitoring</h2>
      <p>
        An essential part of bird conservation is monitoring and recording
        information about the species such as their numbers, breeding habits,
        etc. Scientific research may be carried out to determine whether a
        species is in decline and how to address the problem.
      </p>

      <h2>Habitat protection</h2>
      <p>
        The destruction of habitat is a serious threat to many birds and
        therefore protecting habitats is crucial to protecting the species.
      </p>

      <h2>Control invasive plants and animals</h2>
      <p>
        Mink and rats are a predator that threaten many bird species, for
        example by eating their eggs.
